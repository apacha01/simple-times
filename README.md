# Simple Times
Small clock project to practice the use of npm and npm modules.

## Instalation
Clonning the repository and running ```npm install``` should do. 
##### Note
The project should work regardless of how it's started, but since the main .js file uses fetch you may want to use something like the **Live Server** extension from VS Code to get a list of timezones available.
